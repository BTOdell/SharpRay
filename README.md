# SharpRay
A ray tracing benchmark for C# .NET

Based on the code from [the Ray tracing YouTube series by The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW1Fhd9u9Q&list=PLlrATfBNZ98edc5GshdBtREv5asFW3yXl).

This is a CPU ray tracer. It only uses [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET) for windowing and copying the ray traced pixel data to the screen.
